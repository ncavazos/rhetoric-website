        <p>I chose this first meme because I think it neatly addresses
           the "stock stories" aspect we read about for this weeks
           assignment. Almost each person that is being referred to
           in the picture has a vastly different idea of what it is us
           musicians do. I find it funny how the girlfriend views it as
           simply playing with toys yet the person themselves thinks they
           are some sort of rocket-scientist.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="isi" src="images/2.png">
        <p>This next meme is quite funny as well. I would probably
           cross out the word Raver and put the word electronic musician
           in its place but the idea still works. If you ever begin to get
           into electronic music you realize how wide the genre actually is.
           House music is very different from say drum and bass or trance yet
           most people would have no idea what these words even meant which
           shows how much of a rabbit hole this culture can become. </p>
        <br>
        <img class="isi" src="images/3.png">
        <p>The third meme points out the fact that music producers tend
           to be big spenders of money which is also usually true. There
           are always new pieces of gear or software to buy and almost
           everyone I know falls into the collection habit sooner or later </p>
        <br>

        <p> This image is pretty accurate. Whenever I go to a show as of
            late I am mostly paying attention to how the sound was designed,
             the arrangement of the track and many other production details.
             It becomes almost the whole point of even attending shows in the
             first place. If the music isn't interesting and theres nothing
             worth listening to you might as well leave! </p>
        <br>

        <p>  I like this meme a lot because to so many people DJing and
             producing electronic music is just a series of mindlessly
             pushing buttons when in actuality both are quite deep and
             complex subjects to learn. While there are new trends that
             make both DJing and producing easy than ever before it doesn't
             negate the fact that there are people who take off the training
             wheels so to speak and when you see something like this in a
             performance its quite an incredible experience. </p>

The music communities that I am a part of are usually some of the most loyal people that I know.  Whenever there are issues and situations where certain artists are harmed by others there tends to largely be a community discussion that addresses the conflict.

An example I have that comes to mind recently is when a local group of artists had been given a night to play their music at a fancy new venue down in the west bottoms area of kansas city. This new venue has been known to play favorites with certain lets say wealthier people in the music scene. This has led to a sense of soft-gatekeeping by the community.

When this new venue decided to book a new group of electronic artists everyone was excited for the performance. This was to be an actual live performance on drum machines and synthesizers as opposed to strictly just a DJ set. The performing group had emailed the venue ahead of time with music samples of their style and sound to make sure they would be a good fit, to which the venue agreed.

Ultimately what ended up happening was the group began their performance and then midway through their set one of the three owners of the venue had had enough of their sound and decided to have them pull the plug on their liveset, even though the venue was packed and having a great time.

This led to a sense of frustration not only for the cut in the planned performance but also for the fact that the performers had thousands of dollars of gear left on the DJ booth, at which point the people who were picked to replace them began setting up their gear on top of this equipment, with no respect for the performers or their gear.

This ended up being quite a dramatic instance in our community. Not only did it resonate across our community but also reddit.com/r/kansascity as well. A pretty popular post made it to the front page of the /r/kansascity site which can be found at the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/1ds3c5p/in_the_lowest_ferns_is_a_terrible_venue/ .

Many people in the comments were also upset that they had paid money to see a certain performance, were even enjoying the performance and then had said performance canceled. It was rather fascinating to witness all of this happen live.
